# Why Reflection is Important

In 1969, Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist, arranged an experiment. He left
an abandoned car in a parking lot in Palo Alto and observed it for a week. During
that time, the car remained untouched. In phase two of the experiment, he broke
one of the car's windows with a sledgehammer. Almost immediately, the car was
vandalized and stripped for parts within a day. This led to the concept behind the
Broken Window Theory—the idea that a single visible sign of neglect, like a broken
window, can invite further damage and decay.

There are things in our daily lives that we may not consciously notice, but our
subconscious mind does—and these unnoticed details have real effects on us.
Carelessness is contagious. Ignoring a broken situation sends the message that
nothing can be fixed, that no one cares. This is why we should address broken
windows as soon as we see them—not simply to fix for the sake of fixing, but to
cultivate the habit of doing things thoroughly, avoiding half-hearted efforts. But
how can we fix what’s broken if we’re not actively looking for it?

At the start of each day, I write a to-do list. Lately, I’ve been experimenting with
creating a _success list_ from those tasks (inspired by _The One Thing_ by Gary
Keller). I also track my deep work sessions by marking boxes on my to-do list, as
people play differently when they're keeping score. The specific items on the to-do
list aren't what matters most; what’s important is having a place where you can
reference what you worked on and for how long.

As an additional habit, I mark X’s on my calendar to build consistency in working
every day. At the end of each week, I review the past days, focusing on the deep
work sessions and my accomplishments. I celebrate the good weeks and reflect on
the bad ones, digging deeper to understand why they didn’t go as planned. The
goal is to maintain awareness of my habits, so I can adjust them when something
isn’t working.

The concept is simple, but it’s far from easy. The hardest part of achieving anything
is taking action. Discipline is required to form habits, and reflection is needed to
break bad ones. The challenge I’ve struggled with most is time. Success doesn’t
happen all at once—it’s sequential. Instead of aiming for massive, overwhelming
goals, execution should focus on a small number of _wildly important goals_
(as discussed in _Deep Work_ by Cal Newport).

For example, I want to become a Software Engineer. There’s so much involved in
reaching that goal: interview preparation, building projects, marketing myself, and
developing the ability to learn quickly. It’s easy to feel crushed by the weight of it
all, especially for someone without a degree. So what’s my approach? I identify a
few attainable goals and focus deeply on one feature at a time during my work
sessions. I also build my knowledge portfolio by reading and connecting ideas in
Obsidian.

Everyone has off days—or even off weeks—I know I’ve had plenty. But I keep
moving forward. I'll continue pushing because success is sequential, and I know
that if I keep at it, I’ll get there one day.
